/**
 * Plannotator Plugin for OpenCode
 *
 * Provides a Claude Code-style planning experience with interactive plan review.
 * When the agent calls submit_plan, the Plannotator UI opens for the user to
 * annotate, approve, or request changes to the plan.
 *
 * Environment variables:
 *   PLANNOTATOR_REMOTE - Set to "1" or "true" for remote mode (devcontainer, SSH)
 *   PLANNOTATOR_PORT   - Fixed port to use (default: random locally, 19432 for remote)

## Plan Submission

When you have completed your plan, you MUST call the \`submit_plan\` tool to submit it for user review.
The user will be able to:
- Review your plan visually in a dedicated UI
- Annotate specific sections with feedback
- Approve the plan to proceed with implementation
- Request changes with detailed feedback

If your plan is rejected, you will receive the user's annotated feedback. Revise your plan
based on their feedback and call submit_plan again.

Do NOT proceed with implementation until your plan is approved.

Proceed with implementation, incorporating these notes where applicable.`;
